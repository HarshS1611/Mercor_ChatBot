Accessories Bot is designed to provide personalized product recommendations based on user inputs and preferences. It utilizes the G-Series AI models, including GPT and LLM, for its natural language processing capabilities. The frontend of the chatbot is built using the textbase framework, as per the prerequisites and requirements of the Hackathon, without using React.js.

# Features:

The chatbot supports text-based interactions.
It responds to greetings like "hi" with a friendly "hello."
Users can input their preferences, such as "I have Nike shoes," and receive relevant suggestions.
Product Exploration:

Users can click on "explore" to receive a list of products based on their input.
For instance, if a user mentions having Nike shoes, the chatbot will recommend related products like shoe racks and other shoe accessories.
Voice Recording Feature:

An exciting addition to Accessories Bot is the voice recording feature.
Users can click on "start recording" and provide a voice prompt.
The chatbot responds with suggestions and product recommendations based on the voice input.
For example, a user saying "I want Nike shoes and an anime shirt" will result in relevant responses and product suggestions.
Demo:

# Text Interaction Demo:

# Additional Notes:

The recommendation system considers the user's conversation history with the bot for more personalized suggestions.
The project has the potential for further improvements, including reducing latency in recommendations and optimizing conversation flow.
